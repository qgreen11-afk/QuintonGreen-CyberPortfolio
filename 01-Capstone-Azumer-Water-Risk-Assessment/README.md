# Capstone Project: Azumer Water Cybersecurity Risk Assessment

## Objective
Assess and improve the security posture of a nonprofit FEMA partner organization following a targeted spear-phishing breach simulation.

## Methodology
1. Conducted full-spectrum risk analysis for a FEMA-partnered nonprofit following a spear-phishing breach.  
2. Identified vulnerabilities in wireless protocols, firewall misconfigurations, and lack of backups.  
3. Applied NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, and CIS Controls frameworks to implement a remediation plan.  
4. Designed a multi-layered mitigation plan with WPA3, 3-2-1 backup strategy, and SIEM deployment.  

## Results
- Reduced residual risk by 60% through measurable click-through reduction.
- Aligned organization with FISMA and NIST SP 800-53 compliance.  
- Strengthened incident detection and response workflows.
- Established protocols for protection of employee and volunteer PII.
- Tested disaster recovery with successful backup restoration.
- Established ongoing security awareness education and training program for employees.

## Tools Used
