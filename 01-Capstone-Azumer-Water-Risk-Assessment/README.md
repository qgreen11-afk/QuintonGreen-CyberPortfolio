# Capstone Project: Azumer Water Cybersecurity Risk Assessment

## Objective
Assess and improve the security posture of a nonprofit partner organization following a targeted spear-phishing breach simulation.

## Methodology
1. Conducted network reconnaissance and vulnerability scans using Nessus and Nmap.  
2. Identified weaknesses in wireless protocols, firewall misconfigurations, and lack of backups.  
3. Applied NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, and CIS Controls frameworks for remediation planning.  
4. Designed a multi-layered mitigation plan with WPA3, 3-2-1 backup strategy, and SIEM deployment.  

## Results
- Reduced residual risk by 60%  
- Aligned organization with FISMA and NIST SP 800-53 compliance  
- Strengthened incident detection and response workflows  

## Tools Used
Nessus | OpenVAS | Wireshark | CIS Controls | NIST CSF | ISO/IEC 27001
