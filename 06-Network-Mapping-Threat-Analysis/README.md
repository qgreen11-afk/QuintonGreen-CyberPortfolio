# ðŸ§  Emerging Technologies Project 6: Network Mapping & Threat Analysis

**Objective:**  
Performed a network security assessment using **Nmap** and **Wireshark** to identify active hosts, vulnerabilities, and insecure services.

**Summary:**  
- Mapped a **star topology** network with six active hosts.  
- Identified **legacy systems** (Windows 7, Linux 2.6.32) and insecure services (**FTP/Port 21**, **HTTP/Port 80**).  
- Captured and analyzed network traffic with **Wireshark**, revealing plaintext credential transmission.  
- Evaluated risks of **Man-in-the-Middle** and **sniffing attacks**.

**Outcome:**  
- Recommended replacing insecure protocols with **FTPS/SFTP** and **HTTPS**.  
- Suggested patching legacy systems and implementing **vulnerability management** practices.  

**Tools & Techniques:**  
`Nmap` | `Wireshark` | `Network Enumeration` | `Packet Analysis` | `OS Fingerprinting`
