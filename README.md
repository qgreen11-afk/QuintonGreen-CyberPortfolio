## 💡 About Me
I'm a dedicated cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience across multiple domains — from penetration testing and vulnerability assessment to cloud defense, forensics, and governance, risk and compliance. As a graduate student at **Western Governors University**, I combine academic excellence with real-world practice through DoD experience and advanced cybersecurity labs. My goal is to continuously expand my expertise across all facets of cybersecurity — red teaming, blue teaming, cloud, incident response, and governance — to help organizations build resilient and secure infrastructures.
