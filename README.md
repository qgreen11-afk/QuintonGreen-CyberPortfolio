## 🧠 About Me
I'm a cybersecurity graduate student with hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment, risk mitigation, and compliance analysis through the U.S. Department of Defense and academic research projects. My work combines offensive red teaming techniques, defensive blue teaming techniques and assessments, with risk-based security engineering and control frameworks like NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001, and CIS Controls.
