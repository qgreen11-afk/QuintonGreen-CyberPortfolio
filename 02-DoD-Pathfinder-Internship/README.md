# DoD CY24 Pathfinder Internship â€“ Red Teaming & Vulnerability Analysis

## Objective
Completed 6-week paid internship focused on offensive security penetration testing, red team operations, and DevSecOps.

Completed a simulated Grey-Box Penetration Test

## Methodology
1. Conducted vulnerability identification, active and passive reconnaissance, and exploitation.
2. Participated in a team in a Grey-Box penetration test against a simulated enterprise environment (Windows, Linux, Web) using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework to evaluate compliance and security posture.
3. Conducted Network Scanning (Nmap) and SMB Enumeration (enum4linux) to identify active services and discover high-priority findings, including Outdated SMBv1 and Anonymous Share Access.
4. Performed advanced exploitation techniques, including Kerberoasting to find valid usernames, password cracking (Hashcat), and Privilege Escalation using PrivescCheck.ps1 to gain Administrator access.
5. 

## Results
- Delivered prioritized risk report simulating real-world penetration testing
- Delivered a comprehensive security overview with prioritized remediation steps to disable SMBv1, enforce strong access controls, and address vulnerable web and application server versions.
