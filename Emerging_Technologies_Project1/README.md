# ðŸ§  Emerging Technologies Project 1: Network Mapping & Threat Analysis

**Objective:**  
Performed a full network security assessment to identify vulnerabilities, insecure services, and potential attack vectors using **Nmap** and **Wireshark**.

**Summary:**  
- Mapped a target network and identified a **star topology** with six active hosts.  
- Discovered **legacy operating systems** (Windows 7, Linux 2.6.32) and insecure open services (**FTP on Port 21** and **HTTP on Port 80**).  
- Used **Wireshark** to capture and analyze traffic, confirming plaintext **credential transmission** over unencrypted protocols.  
- Conducted threat analysis identifying **Man-in-the-Middle** and **sniffing** risks from insecure traffic.  

**Outcome:**  
- Delivered **vulnerability remediation recommendations** including:  
  - Deprecation of unencrypted protocols (FTP/HTTP).  
  - Implementation of **FTPS/SFTP and HTTPS**.  
  - Upgrading outdated operating systems and applying patch management processes.  
- Enhanced understanding of **vulnerability management and secure communication protocols**.  

**Tools & Techniques:**  
`Nmap` | `Wireshark` | `Network Enumeration` | `Packet Analysis` | `Vulnerability Identification` | `OS Fingerprinting`
